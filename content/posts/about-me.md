### Hello Everyone
My name is **Jan**. I'm undergraduate **CS student** and **QA Engineer** with 2 years of proffesional experience. 

In my everyday work I'm not only involved in software testing but also in cooperation with customers and project/team management. 

I'm using **Python** as my main language, but I also have experience in Java and JavaScript. I was developing automated tests for both desktop and web applications.

I still haven't found my desired career path, but curretnly I'm focused on developing myself in area of cybersecurity and Web 3.0

When I'm not spending time in front of the computer working or studying I read books, cook and learn foreign languages. When I have a little bit more of free time I'm trying to travel and visit as many new places as I can. 

Lately I've also discovered Stoicism and since that moment I'm trying to implement Stoics wisdom into my everyday life.

That is all about me. I will be sharing here thoughts and insights from my professional and also self development journey. 

I hope that each of you will find something valuable here.
